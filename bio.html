					Hi! I'm Katie, and I am currently a senior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My previous work has been in the Data Analytics field creating analytics applications and features for an existing analytics application. I am currently looking for full time opportunities, preferably in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I am from originally. On campus, I am a member of Chi Omega, a teaching assistant for an introductory CS course in C++ and recently joined the Tufts Climbing Team.
