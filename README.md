Personal Profile Page

The corresponding index.html file, stylesheet and linked html pages correctly
implement a personal website with a welcome page, and links to a bio and 
resume. The index.html file shows a photo and links not only to my bio
and resume, implemented in other html files, but also has buttons that link
to social media sites. Upon clicking on the bio link the user will see a brief
bio of me as well as a back button to return back to the home page. Similarly,
if the user clicks on the resume link they will be taken to a page outlining
my experience. This page also has a back button. The page can be accessed
by going to khoskins.github.io or www.cs.tufts.edu/~khoski01, which will
automatically redirect to the github pgae. 

In working on this assignment I asked Claudia Mihm for some help with github. 
I spent 7 hours developing this page.
